# VBA-automations-2
Problem-We had to update portfolio of several EY employees based on data provided on their investements.
Time savings of upto 91% achieved through this.
WE had three files 1.Current file, 2. Previous file 3. Internal website data report.
This macro was prepared to prepare the current file to the desired format.
Then it deletes rows based on certain conditions and formats a new file.
After which it opened a new sheet and applied lookups to a 2d grid and gave us required data.
It then compares this data with the help of concatenation and identifies cases where no action is required.
